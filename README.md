# Script-for-running-Digital-from-Desktop
This script will allow you to easily run the Digital software without having to interact with the CLI. 

## How to setup (**For Windows**)
1. You'll need to follow the initial instructions that were provided in the canvas module, "Labs Simulation Software Installation Instructions" where you'll download Digital and java.
 
2. A prerequisit for this script is to download [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) so that you'll be able to run the script using "Git bash" without having to use a CLI.

3. You can download the script itself or copy and paste it into your own IDE/text editor, keeping it in your downloads is alright, but I personally moved mine to my documents directory. You'll have to edit yourself in that script where your **digital.jar** file is, (this will be inside the digital folder that you unzipped from the canvas download). If you're unsure of the location, you can view the properties of the script and copy and paste it there.

4. Right clicking on your desktop, hover over "new", then "shortcuts." When prompted for a location for the shortcut, copy the location of the .sh file, making sure to include the file itself:

Your desktop shortcut should look something like this:

Double clicking on the desktop shortcut, the Digital software should open. If it didn't open or the cmd screen opens briefly, I would suggest double checking your location.
